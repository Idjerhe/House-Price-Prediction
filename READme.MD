# House Price Prediction – Regression Project

This project uses the **Ames Housing Dataset** to predict house sale prices using a `RandomForestRegressor`. It involves cleaning, encoding, scaling, model training, evaluation, and feature interpretation.

---

 Project Goals

- Predict house prices accurately using regression models
- Identify the most important factors influencing house prices
- Evaluate model performance using MAE, RMSE, and R²

 Dataset Info

-  Source: [Ames Housing Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prevek18/ames-housing-dataset)
-  80+ features (numerical and categorical)
-  Target: `SalePrice`

---

##  Preprocessing Steps

- Missing values handled using:
  - Median for numerical columns
  - Mode for categorical columns
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables
- Scaled using `MinMaxScaler`
